=============================Commands
>react-native init NewApplication
Create a new application

> react-native start
Get the development server up and running on port 8081

> react-native run-ios 
> react-native run-android
Build the application and load it up onto the device. Be careful running these commands above since they tend to open new Terminal windows in the background

> react-native link
React Native can automatically link package dependencies like react-native-maps in iOS and Android. This avoids clicking through menus in Android Studio and Xcode.

> npm install
Call npm install after cloning a repository to download all the related packages.

> ps aux | grep react-native
Show any running react-native development servers that are running. I usually run this when I want to see if my port is blocked and I need to kill a dormant process.
